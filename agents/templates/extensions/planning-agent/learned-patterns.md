## Task Decomposition Heuristics

<!-- Curator Agent: Add validated task breakdown patterns here -->
<!-- Example:
### Heuristic: Foundation-First Ordering
Always implement foundational components (domain models, ports) before adapters.
- **Trigger**: Multi-task features with domain entities
- **Evidence**: Reduced rework in 5+ features
-->

---

## Estimation Patterns

<!-- Curator Agent: Add validated estimation learnings here -->
<!-- Example:
### Pattern: Test Task Inflation
Unit test tasks often take 1.5x estimated time when covering edge cases.
- **Trigger**: Tasks with "comprehensive unit tests"
- **Mitigation**: Add buffer for test tasks
-->

---

## Dependency Patterns

<!-- Curator Agent: Add validated dependency ordering patterns here -->
<!-- Example:
### Pattern: Authorization Before Features
Implement authorization service before feature handlers that require it.
- **Trigger**: Features with user data isolation
- **Evidence**: SEC-001 implementation order
-->
