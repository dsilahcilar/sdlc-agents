# Risk Patterns

This file catalogs recurring risk patterns that agents should watch for during planning, coding, and review.

## Risk Pattern Categories

1. **Structural Risk** - Architecture and design concerns
2. **Process Risk** - Development workflow issues
3. **Integration Risk** - External system interactions
4. **Data Risk** - Data handling and integrity
5. **Security Risk** - Vulnerabilities and threats

## Risk Patterns

<!-- Initializer Agent: Analyze the project and add relevant risk patterns below -->
<!-- For each risk pattern, create a section following this structure: -->

<!--
### <CATEGORY>-NNN: <Pattern Name>

**Description:** <What this risk pattern is>

**Signals:**
- <indicator 1>
- <indicator 2>

**Why it's risky:**
- <consequence 1>
- <consequence 2>

**Mitigation:**
- <action 1>
- <action 2>
-->

<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Remove this section after populating with project risks -->

### EXAMPLE-001: (Example - Delete After Review)

**Description:** This is a placeholder risk pattern. Replace with actual project risks.

**Signals:**
- Replace with real signals

**Why it's risky:**
- Replace with real consequences

**Mitigation:**
- Replace with real mitigations

## Adding New Risk Patterns

When a new risk pattern is identified:

1. Create entry with unique ID (CATEGORY-NNN)
2. Describe signals that indicate the pattern
3. Explain why it's risky
4. Document mitigation strategies
5. Have Retro Agent link to incidents that revealed it
