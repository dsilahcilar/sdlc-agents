# SDLC Agents

This project uses SDLC Agents for structured, architecture-aware development.

## Available Agents

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Planning | `agents/planning-agent.md` | Creates structured, implementable plans |
| Coding | `agents/coding-agent.md` | Implements code following approved plans |
| Architect | `agents/architect-agent.md` | Validates architectural decisions |
| Code Review | `agents/codereview-agent.md` | Reviews code for quality and debt |
| Retro | `agents/retro-agent.md` | Extracts lessons learned |
| Curator | `agents/curator-agent.md` | Maintains knowledge quality |
| Initializer | `agents/initializer-agent.md` | Sets up project structure |

## How to Use

1. **First time?** Ask Claude to run the initializer agent
2. **New feature?** Use the planning agent to create a structured plan
3. **Implementing?** Use the coding agent with task files
4. **Done?** Use retro agent to capture lessons learned

## Key Directories

- `agents/` — Agent instructions and shared resources
- `agent-context/` — Project-specific context (created by initializer)
- `agent-context/features/` — Feature plans and task files
- `agent-context/memory/` — Learning playbook
